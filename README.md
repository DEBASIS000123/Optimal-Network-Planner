# Optimal Network Planner

Optimal Network Planner is a project designed to optimize wireless network coverage by strategically placing nodes based on signal strength (RSSI). Using advanced clustering techniques and path planning algorithms like K-Median clustering and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the tool identifies key locations (primary nodes) that maximize network strength and coverage. Secondary nodes, which are closely related to primary nodes, are also considered to ensure comprehensive coverage across the target area. The project aims to provide a robust solution for network optimization, ensuring the strongest possible signal across the region while minimizing travel paths for maintenance and setup.

A summary of the key features or functionalities of your project.

<b>Clustering Techniques:<b/>  Utilizes Manhattan distance-based clustering and K-median clustering to group data points by signal strength.
Path Planning Algorithms: Implements the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the shortest path covering all primary nodes.
Correlation Analysis: Uses a correlation matrix to identify primary and secondary nodes based on RSSI relationships.


---

## Methodology
An overview of the methods and algorithms used in the project, explained in simple terms.

Data Clustering: Raw data with longitude, latitude, and RSSI values is first clustered into smaller groups using Manhattan clustering.
Re-Clustering: These clusters are further refined using K-median clustering to reduce the number of groups and focus on key signal areas.
Correlation Matrix: A 20x20 correlation matrix is created to identify the strength of relationships between clusters, helping to distinguish primary nodes from secondary ones.
Path Optimization: The TSP algorithm is used to find the shortest path that covers all primary nodes, ensuring optimal network strength.

---

## Visualization
Explain how the results are visualized for better understanding and analysis.

Graph and Map Visualization: The shortest path and node locations are plotted on a graph and map, respectively, to visualize coverage areas and optimize planning.
Heatmaps and Network Diagrams: Additional visualizations, such as heatmaps, show signal strength across different areas to identify potential coverage gaps.

---

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the project or implement the algorithms for their use case.

Data Preparation: Input raw data with longitude, latitude, and RSSI values.
Run Clustering: Use the provided scripts to perform clustering and re-clustering on the data.
Analyze Correlation: Generate the correlation matrix to identify primary and secondary nodes.

## How to Find Primary and secondary nodes?
Make a 20X20 co-relation matrix according to the cluster number for each sub-clusters and the result of co-relation matrix should be calculated according to the avarage RSSI strength of that sub-cluster. Then count the total relation and take the highest as the primary Node and check the relation where the relation is more than 0.3 and store these cluster in to a variable calling secondary Node.
after that clear the primary and secondary Nodes and Do repeat the process again untill the co-relation matrix is 0.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/DEBASIS000123/Optimal-Network-Planner/blob/main/photos/comatrix.jpg" alt="before" width="300"/></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/DEBASIS000123/Optimal-Network-Planner/blob/main/photos/comatrix2.jpg" alt="after" width="300"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Co-relation Matrix</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>After doing 0</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now secondary Nodes are comming under primary Nodes and if we travel the primary nodes then we can travel secondary nodes as well as primary nodes. 
Here is the primary Node and Secondary Node Lists:<br/><br/>

<br/><br /><br />

And This is the poltting of the primary nodes and if you take this areas then we can cover all the area with a lower cost. There are only 744 points by which we can travel all the areas.

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? üå∑

You can <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%AD%90 Star &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Star Badge"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%B5%96 Fork &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Fork Badge"/> Starring and Forking is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [here](https://github.com/DEBASIS000123/Path-Planning-using-UAV) if you aren't here already and click ‚ûû **‚ú∞ Star and ‚µñ Fork button in the top right corner. You'll be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="20vw" />

1. Go [here](https://github.com/DEBASIS000123/Path-Planning-using-UAV) and click the big green ‚ûû **Code button in the top right of the page, then click ‚ûû [Download ZIP](https://github.com/DEBASIS000123/Path-Planning-using-UAV).

    <img alt="Download ZIP" src="https://github.com/DEBASIS000123/Path-Planning-using-UAV/blob/main/photos/offline_save.jpg" width="400">
2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    Kernel > Restart & Clear Output
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
